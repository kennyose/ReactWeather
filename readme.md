# Weather App

An easy way to know the weather condition around you.

Built with :coffee: and :heart: as part of a daily challenge.

This app was built with [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Webpack 2.X](https://webpack.github.io/), and [Foundation](foundation.zurb.com/). 

With this weather app, you can check the weather condition accurate to 10 blocks around where you stay :blush:
